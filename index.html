                <h1>
                    OFFICIAL BELL CURVE DECLARATION
                </h1>

                <h3>
                    By signing, The Initiate binds eternally to The BellCurved Order, forsaking mediocrity for a life of
                    extremes—rise or perish.
                </h3>

                <h2>
                    THE PURPOSE:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This pact inducts you into the BellCurved Order, rejecting mediocrity for greatness & granting
                    access to
                    sacred JPEGs—divine artifacts celebrating life at the extremes.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    OBLIGATIONS OF THE INITIATE
                </h2>

                <p>
                    As a member, you vow to: a Accumulate Solana as a satirical gesture, b Exchange JPEGs, valuing them
                    only by your enlightened perception, & c Embrace value as an illusion—price fluctuations are simply
                    tests of your resolve.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    MEMBER RIGHTS & PRIVILEGES
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Upon signing, The Initiate gains: A Access to the BellCurved Brotherhood, a network of extreme
                    achievers; B The right to mock the normies stuck in the middle; C A lifetime commitment to seeing
                    your
                    JPEG as priceless.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    By signing, you accept the risks of joining a shadowy brotherhood of degens: financial loss
                    (irrelevant), disapproval from normies (expected), and total detachment from reality (desired).
                </p>

                    By signing, you acknowledge that you may or may not have read or understood this legally ambiguous
                    contract, binding you to a possibly intergalactic entity. Nothing here is real unless you believe;
                    auto-renews on eclipses, retrogrades, or Tuesdays. Enjoy the ride.
